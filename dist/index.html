  Problem description

  Many times, you're in a rush to get somewhere and just leave the house, but
  there's still so much to turn off and deal in many divisions of said house. Or,
  even worse, you just left the house and realized you left the stove on, what
  will you do?

  Imagine when you're trying to cook a really nice tasty meal but you still have
  to keep a eye on your children while they're playing on the backyard. The struggle
  to manage both situations can be tough to handle.

  When you're really air headed and just can't remember where you put the tv
  remote and your mom keeps nagging to turn the volume down.

  Many problems that derive from these types of situations can be called simple
  and mundane problems, but everyone has had the misfortune to deal with them
  and lost their precious time on them (and we all know time is money).

  - Target users

  We want to make our product accessible and easy to use to most people so we aim it to people from all ages and different backgrounds as long
  as they have smart appliances which can connect to our system.

  - Project goal

  Everyday, more and more devices are connected to the internet, the goal is
  to control your house without actually being phisically present. Smarter Hub
  aims for excelency and efficiency: with a simple and intiutive interface,
  users will be able to better manage their time and effort.

  With Smarter Hub, a click (and internet connection) will be enough to plan
  your house chores and executing multiple of those at the same time.
  It will also help reducing how many of the house devices are uselessly turned
  on, being one click away from solving that problem.

  Smarter Hub will offer its' solution with an interface that offers its' users
  the ability to map their house's blueprint and let them place/register the
  devices from each room/division in the house. To each object, a personalized
  control panel will be displayed. This control panel will display the object's
  state and possible actions (per example, if it's a light, then the options
  will be on and off).

  - Improvement over other designs

  Atmos - Super Home 2.0 is a device that offers the control over your house
  devices, it lets the user control the lightning, climate control and
  entertainmet. Super Home 2.0 crosses off the need to have multiple applications for
  each type of device in your house, the user just needs their device and it can
  offer the means and ways to make the user's home a smart home.
  Atmos sells their product by saying it's high security because
  you need the user's voice for anything to work, even though this is an advantage,
  it is also their step back.
  Super Home 2.0 needs the user to be phisically present.
  Smarter Hub oversteps this need and lets the user take control of their house
  any time they want, when they want.
